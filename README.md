# bookclub

This is a php and sql based project. The main aim of this project is to provide a platform to share books among each other. It also provides a feature to chat with other users and to add or remove a book.

Users can sign up according to their requirement which is book borrower or lender.

To run this project install the sql db file in mamp or other similar sql server. User id and pass is available in db or just simply sign up but for better understanding use the id/pass from db.

To launch project start the server then run the signin file.

Thank You.

Hope you like it.
